      It’s a high bar to get a court to stop a party from doing something it plans to do. Usually, the action is taken and the legal system sorts out later whether the law provides a remedy. Usually, the remedy is a cash payment.
      So-called preliminary relief happens if/when the plaintiff can prove that a failure of the courts to intervene would result in “irreparable harm.” This means that no award of cash later would fix the harm done now, if the party that plans to do something now is permitted to do it.
      That’s what Michigan and Harbaugh need to prove. That no court ruling, no verdict, no outcome down the road can repair the damage done by not letting Harbaugh coach.
      It’s also important for Michigan to show a high likelihood of ultimately winning the case. The closer the legal question presented, the harder it is to get a court to step in.
      That’s the key here. The court system is premised mainly on cleaning up messes later. Sometimes, an effort is made to prevent the mess, with the argument it can never be cleaned up.
      Regardless, it’s already a mess. The clock is ticking toward kickoff, and there have been no ruling. It needs happen ASAP.

    content: `LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - More than 300,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London on Saturday, with police arresting over 120 people as they sought to stop far-right counter-protesters from ambushing the main rally.
      Skirmishes broke out between police and the far-right groups gathered to protest against the demonstration taking place on Armistice Day, the anniversary of the end of World War One, when Britain commemorates its war dead.
      Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the violence seen at the Cenotaph war memorial and also attacked "Hamas sympathisers" who joined the bigger rally, "singing antisemitic chants and brandishing pro-Hamas signs and clothing on today's protest".
      Tensions had been running high before Saturday's march - the biggest in a series to show support for the Palestinians and call for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip - after interior minister Suella Braverman called them "hate marches" led by "mobs".
      London's Metropolitan Police had refused ministerial requests to block the event, saying they did not have indications that there would be serious violence, straining relations with the government.
      Police said in a statement late on Saturday that they had arrested 126 people so far, the majority of whom were right wing protesters who formed part of a group several hundred strong which police said included football hooligans.
      "The extreme violence from the right wing protesters towards the police today was extraordinary and deeply concerning," Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said, adding that a knife and knuckleduster were found during searches.
      The intense debate about protest and policing in the run-up to the march had raised community tensions, he said.
      While the much larger pro-Palestinian rally did not see physical violence, the senior officer said small groups had broken away from the main march, and about 150 people wearing face coverings had fired fireworks which struck officers in their faces, leading to arrests.
      Investigations into a small number of hate crime and support for proscribed organisation offences were also ongoing, he said.
      Sunak called for the police to take a tough line.
      "All criminality must be met with the full and swift force of the law," he said in a statement late on Saturday. "That is what I told the Met Police Commissioner on Wednesday, that is what they are accountable for and that is what I expect."

      Skirmishes between police and right wing protesters continued throughout the day, with police in riot gear using batons to try to contain protesters who threw bottles.
      London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Scotland's first minister, Humza Yousaf, said Braverman had inflamed tensions and emboldened the far-right by accusing the police of favouring "pro-Palestinian mobs" before the event.
      OVER 300,000 JOIN MARCH
      Police said more than 300,000 had joined the pro-Palestinian rally, while organisers put the figure at 800,000.
      Some marchers chanted "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free", a rallying cry viewed by many Jews as antisemitic and a call for Israel's eradication.
      Others carried banners reading "Free Palestine", "Stop the Massacre" and "Stop Bombing Gaza".
      Since Hamas's assault in southern Israel on Oct. 7, there has been strong support and sympathy for Israel from Western governments, including Britain's, and many citizens. But the Israeli military response has also prompted anger, with weekly protests in London demanding a ceasefire.
      In the U.S., hundreds of protesters rallied near President Joe Biden’s house in Wilmington, Delaware, shortly before he arrived home for the weekend. Biden’s motorcade circumvented the demonstration, in which hundreds also walked down the tree-lined street to get closer to the Biden residence. Many wore the Palestinian flag and carried signs demanding a ceasefire.
      Hanaa A., who declined to provide her last name, said she came to Wilmington to protest the killing of innocent children and demand an immediate ceasefire. Asked about the likely contest next November between Biden and former President Donald Trump she said "We will pray and wait, but at this point, we will not elect him (Biden).”
      About 21,000 people took part in a pro-Palestinian rally in Brussels on Saturday, and in Paris, left-wing lawmakers were among some 16,000 protesters who marched with pro-Palestinian banners and flags to call for a ceasefire.
      Some French leftist politicians have welcomed President Emmanuel Macron's call this week for a ceasefire and opposition to Israel's bombing campaign.

    content: `Wegovy cut the risk of serious cardiovascular complications in people with obesity and heart disease in a closely watched trial, demonstrating a particularly large effect on heart attacks, a promising new frontier for the drug.
      The roughly 17,500-person Select study tested Wegovy in people with obesity and heart disease but who did not have diabetes. Weekly injections of Wegovy slashed the overall risk of heart attack, stroke and death from cardiovascular causes by 20%, according to detailed results from the trial presented Saturday at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Novo Nordisk disclosed topline data from the study in August. 
      The findings could expand insurance coverage of Wegovy, a major barrier thus far for the drug and similar GLP-1 agonists, and spur broader use of the anti-obesity drug.
      The new data could also help the Danish pharmaceutical company maintain its lead over Eli Lilly, whose competing weight-loss drug Zepbound was approved in the U.S. earlier this week. Zepbound has been shown to help people lose more weight, but it hasn’t yet demonstrated an effect on cardiovascular outcomes. 
      “If you look at where the insurance companies are going to be obliged to go, they’re going to be obliged to go with the drug that reduces cardiovascular events,” said Dr. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart who was involved with the study.
      Trial results
      Wegovy reduced the risk of non-fatal heart attack by 28% in the five-year trial. It produced a smaller 7% reduction in the occurrence of non-fatal stroke, though few strokes were seen in the trial overall.
      What’s more, Wegovy started to show a reduction in overall cardiovascular events within months of participants starting the drug, with the difference between the drug and placebo widening as the study continued. Researchers observed that effect even before people lost significant weight, a “fascinating” finding that suggests both weight loss and the drug itself could be playing a role in heart health, said Dr. Ania Jastreboff, director of the Yale Obesity Research Center.
      “I think it’s all additive, and I don’t think we can parse out one from the other,” Jastreboff, who was not involved in the study, said at a press briefing.
      About two-thirds of participants had blood sugar levels that put them in the range of prediabetes. Wegovy decreased progression to diabetes by 73%, suggesting the drug could be used as an early treatment. Novo’s Ozempic, which uses the same active ingredient as Wegovy, is approved for diabetes. 
      The study enrolled both patients whose body-mass index met the threshold for overweight or obesity, though most of the patients were considered obese.
      Side effects and limitations.
      Almost 17% of people receiving Wegovy in the trial stopped taking the drug, mainly because of gastrointestinal issues like vomiting and diarrhea, double the rate of people who discontinued the placebo. But more people in the control group experienced serious adverse events such as cardiac disorders and medical procedures. 
      The discontinuations may reflect less familiarity with Wegovy among doctors involved in the study, said Kushner, who specializes in caring for patients who are overweight or have obesity. Adjusting the dosage or tweaking diet can help people navigate unpleasant side effects.
      Participants also lost less weight in this study than previous ones examining Wegovy, though this study didn’t incorporate lifestyle changes and it enrolled people with different characteristics. 
      One limitation of the study was its lack of diversity. Nearly three-quarters of the participants were male, and even more were white. Just about 4% of participants were Black.
      Regardless, doctors expect the results to increase the number of people who take Wegovy. 
      Seeing a diabetes drug producing positive cardiovascular and metabolic effects “opens a new door to treat obese patients with cardiovascular disease,” said Dr. George Dangas, director of cardiovascular innovation for Mount Sinai Hospital. But it could take time and energy to incorporate it into clinical practice.
      “Those are good problems to have,” Dangas said. “We have something good for the patient, that’s great.”

      Mangini suggested that staying closer to home would have been better for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. The couple's relationship has been gaining attention, with Kelce making a grand gesture by traveling to Argentina to support Swift during her tour.
      "I'm a fan of young love and I like Taylor Swift a lot but you could probably see concerts closer to home, you could probably spend some time, you could go to bed at 8:00...now he's doing a lot of work on the side, he's got a lot of really nice um uh endorsements, some recent trademark," Magnini noted.
      "I think Kevin, maybe a little bit closer to home could be positive, but the thing with this with the World Series worked out well for him, so maybe this will this will work out as well."
      Swift has been a regular presence at Kelce's games, meeting his parents and actively supporting him. While the impact on Kelce's football performance remains uncertain, many acknowledge the sincerity of his gesture to spend time with Swift during the bye week.
      The couple was recently spotted holding hands and spending time together in Argentina. The true effect on Kelce's performance will be revealed when the Chiefs play against the Philadelphia Eagles after the bye week.

    content: `FORT WORTH, Texas — Airlines have a record 260 million seats to fill this quarter, and to do it, they’re offering fares that will run you about the same as a pair of movie tickets
      ,for example, last month offered one-way fares of $29 for flights early in the morning or at night, just one example of airline discounting for off-peak periods.
      “I would characterize the amount of discounting or sales that we’re doing today as a bit more than normal,” Ryan Green, Southwest’s chief commercial officer, told reporters at the Skift Aviation Forum earlier this month. He said the industry’s increased capacity in recent months means there are more seats to fill, even though the carrier’s average fare was up in the last quarter from a year ago.
      Leisure travelers, meanwhile, have largely returned to more traditional booking patterns after years of pandemic swings in demand, leaving airlines looking for ways to fill planes outside of holidays or other popular travel periods.
      “Typically, you see a step increase in price at each seven-day mark before a flight,” said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights, a flight-deal company that recently rebranded as Going. But airlines are either dropping last-minute fares or not raising them as much as usual, he said.
      Airlines have scheduled a record 259.8 million seats for domestic flights in the fourth quarter, up nearly 8% from last year, on 1.86 million flights, up 6% from 2022, according to aviation-data firm Cirium.
      Getting the balance right in the off-season is a challenge for airlines, which make the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters during the busy spring and summer seasons. Most major carriers reported record revenue and strong demand during those periods, with some executives reporting higher growth for international destinations over domestic ones.
      Falling fares
      The U.S. inflation read for September showed airfare dropped more than 13% from a year earlier, while overall consumer prices rose.
      JetBlue Airways
      said average fares dropped more than 12% in the third quarter during the same period of 2022 to $201.73.
      Budget carrier Spirit Airlines
      said fares dropped nearly 28% from a year earlier to $48.73, though non-ticket revenue, which includes add-ons such as seat selection fees and checked bags, rose 1% to $67.70.
      The Miramar, Florida-based airline, which JetBlue is trying to buy, warned about fare discounting before Thanksgiving and said, “unfortunately, we have not seen the anticipated return to a normal demand and pricing environment for the peak holiday periods.”
      Fellow ultra-discounter Frontier Airlines
      said fares averaged a little more than $39 in the last quarter, down 32% from a year ago.
      All three carriers forecast losses for the last three months of the year.
      Rethinking capacity
      Declining pricing power in the off-peak periods has forced carriers to rethink where they’re deploying their planes.
      Southwest plans to slow its growth next year to address the shifting demand patterns, though CEO Bob Jordan described demand on an earnings call late last month as “strong.”
      “Capacity is the most precious commodity you have to produce revenue, and you got to deploy that capacity as efficiently as possible against demand,” Jordan said during the Skift Aviation Forum.
      The carrier is planning to fly less on nonpeak days, like Tuesdays, compared with higher-demand periods, a measure that also prioritizes crews’ time so they are ready fly more when it’s busy, Jordan said.
      Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told CNBC that one thing the airline is changing is finding less crowded markets for its flights.
      “We are concentrating our growth away from the saturated markets,” he said. “We will not shrink in Orlando and Vegas, but we’re probably not going to grow it either.”
      Holiday demand is still strong
      With shifting demand comes those eye-catching, double-digit fares.
      But they’re usually gone quickly and are nearly guaranteed to be unavailable for peak holiday periods, with demand expected to hit or break records.
      Delta Air Lines.
      said it expects to carry between 6.2 million and 6.4 million passengers from Nov. 17 to Nov. 28 during the Thanksgiving period, compared with 5.7 million last year and 6.25 million in 2019. United Airlines said it expects to fly 5.9 million passengers from Nov. 17 to Nov. 29, up 13% from last year and 5% more than 2019. American Airlines
      forecast a record 7.8 million travelers from Nov. 16 to Nov. 28, up from 7 million last year and beating out 2019 by around 200,000 customers.
      Southwest CEO Jordan said year-end holiday bookings are running ahead of last year’s pace.
      Flight tracker Hopper said “good deal” domestic fares, which it defines as the bottom 10th percentile of available fares, are averaging $248 for Thanksgiving, down from $271 last year and $276 in 2019.
      Could it last?
      Airlines are now poring over their schedules for 2024 to try to best use their aircraft while they face higher costs such as fuel and labor that have pinched margins.
      “You’re seeing carriers put out fares that look kind of like our fares, and what you should really think about is that that’s not going to be permanent,” Frontier’s CEO Biffle said, citing costs.
      Carriers have gotten more sophisticated about addressing shifting demand patterns, meaning they can cut flights or capacity during travel lulls.
      Next year, fares are likely to stabilize, but it’s too early to tell what promotional fares will be, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel industry consulting firm Atmosphere Research Group.
      “If inflation really continues at the torrid place it has been, if we see hiring soften, airlines may feel a need to invest in deeper promotion,” he said.
      One advantage for full-service carriers is the variety of fares and products they can offer, from no-frills basic economy to first class, Harteveldt. That means they could increase their inventory of cheaper basic economy fares during weaker demand periods, or raise fares when demand is high for premium seats.
      Airlines “have the most sophisticated cash registers of any industry,” he said."

    content: `The Louisiana Legislature has until Jan. 15 to enact a new congressional map after a lower court ruled that the current boundaries weaken the power of Black voters in the state, an appeals court ruled Friday.
      The order by a three-judge panel in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals was released Friday. It tosses out the 2022 ruling, and it is the latest in the state’s redistricting fight, which could determine which party controls the state House following the 2024 elections.
      The order said “the district court’s 2022 preliminary injunction, issued with the urgency of establishing a map for the 2022 elections, is no longer necessary.”
      The opinion clarified that uncertainty remains regarding how external factors could affect developments in the case ahead of Jan. 15. Current Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards may call a special session to redraw the boundaries, but Republican Gov.-elect Jeff Landry could also call a special redistricting session in the handful of days following his Jan. 8 inauguration.
      If the Legislature does not take up the plan and create a new map, a lower district could conduct a trial.
      The court argued “an opportunity to adopt a new plan is appropriate since redistricting is a quintessential obligation of a state after a census.
      Bel Edwards previously vetoed new congressional maps that were advanced by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature. Bel Edwards said he thought the maps did not accurately reflect the makeup of Louisiana, a state where nearly 33 percent of residents are Black.
      With the proposed districts, only one of the state’s six districts would have had a majority-Black population.
      An earlier map was blocked by a federal district judge’s preliminary ruling, which sided with a group of Black voters that claim the map design violated the Voting Rights Act.
      The state’s Legislature overrode Bel Edward’s veto, the first time in nearly three decades that lawmakers refused to accept a governor’s refusal of a bill they had passed.
      Republicans argued that the map was fair and the state’s Black population was too dispersed across the state to warrant a second district.
      The district court would need to consider whether the new plan is in line with the Voting Rights Act or whether another preliminary injunction is necessary, the appeals court argued Friday.
      The court argued they chose the Jan. 15 deadline because they wanted to “allow newly elected officials to play an effective role in the process.” `,

    content: `The Big Ten felt like it had to make something up. So it made something up.
      While Jim Harbaugh and the rest of his Michigan football team were on a plane to State College for the huge matchup with Penn State on Saturday, the conference took a half-measure. The Big Ten suspended Harbaugh from the sideline of the Wolverines’ three remaining regular-season games, which includes the season-finale against Ohio State. Michigan’s program is being punished amid the impermissible scouting and sign-stealing scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions.
      Harbaugh, hilariously, will still be permitted to coach and be around his team during the week — he just can’t be on the sideline. He can help formulate game plans and instruct his assistants but can’t stand on the sideline on Saturdays. Is he suspended or not?
      This was all done under the Big Ten sportsmanship policy, which creates a precedent that could lead to anarchy down the road as it pertains to other programs’ future (or past) transgressions.
      Aside from this all seemingly being put together with duct tape, who wins from this?
      Do the Big Ten coaches and administrators, who have been livid about Michigan’s sign-stealing enterprise, win with this sloppy, abrupt and made-up punishment that happened after Harbaugh already boarded the team plane for Pennsylvania? Do Ohio State fans, who will seek revenge against a coach-less rival? Do Penn State fans, who are desperate for a breakthrough win? Do casual college football fans, who just want to watch a national title contender play football on Saturday?
      To what end? Is anyone — literally anyone — who was out for Harbaugh’s blood satiated by this manufactured penalty?
      Nobody wins. Nothing makes sense.
      Suspended Jim Harbaugh is tainted, too, but this Michigan season should not be
      This isn’t to say Harbaugh shouldn’t be punished for what has already proven to have occurred or has yet to be discovered. There is irrefutable evidence that Stalions was stealing signs outside of the scope of the rules and that Michigan was using them. That isn’t allowed, and there is a buck to pay for that infraction.
      But why is the punishment coming now? Why is it rushed? Who is it for?
      There are so many questions about the scandal left unanswered.
      • Did Harbaugh design the plan and/or have knowledge of where Stalions was getting his information?
      • How much of a competitive advantage did Michigan get from this? Did the Wolverines win games they would have lost as a result of that advantage?
      • Did the Wolverines skirt gamesmanship rules or were they Cheating with a capital C?
      • Which assistant coaches were complicit?
      • Did, gulp, any players know?
      That list could go on for another 1,000 words. The answers to those questions are being investigated by the NCAA. From where I’m sitting, I’d rather make any decisions about punishment with the full scope of the facts. If/when Harbaugh is punished, it would feel more just, more appropriate, more calculated than whatever happened here Friday.
      Due process to its fullest extent. Justice. You know the deal. When we get those things, it could eventually lead to a punishment as serious as Harbaugh being fired. If the facts — emphasis on facts — come out and they show he had his hand on the nuclear button and is some sort of cheating mastermind, it would be appropriate for him to be fired. Ban him from the entire sport, for all I care. At this point, he already deserves some kind of punishment for overseeing a program that was running an illegal sign-stealing enterprise whether he knew about it or not.
      But punish him when it’s appropriate to punish him: once the NCAA investigation concludes. This seems like a knee-jerk reaction to satisfy (rightfully) outraged coaches and angry fans on social media platforms. People want some sort of punishment now, and first-year Big Ten commissioner Tony Pettiti obliged.
      Could you imagine Greg Sankey having conference calls with the rest of the SEC to determine what to do with Alabama? It wouldn’t happen.
      And the result of this is making the product we love to consume a little less compelling.
      Some of you are cheering for this penalty because you’re interested in preserving the integrity of the game. Don’t take this column as me saying you’re wrong for wanting punishment. Cheaters are the worst, rules exist to be enforced and violators of those rules need to be punished. I’m right there with you. After due process.
      Yes, we have enough information to know Michigan was working outside of the rules. And yes, the Big Ten has also stated that it reserves the right to levy further punishment on Harbaugh with the revelation of more facts and details. But that means the Big Ten doesn’t have all the facts or details. A punishment was still given.
      Hammer Harbaugh and suspend him indefinitely, fine him a boatload of money or do nothing. Don’t do this half-assed punishment that only stands to make everyone angry. It does nothing for anybody.
      The Big Ten isn’t restoring order in a sport that has been compromised. Stalions is no longer an employee at Michigan, and Harbaugh is still permitted to coach his team during the week. The coordinators — who were seen standing directly next to Stalions on the sideline as he spoon-fed information — are still coaching. The players who are receiving the calls and (maybe) always in the right place at the right time are still going to be playing in the games. Oh, and at the end of this, Harbaugh might still get to coach his team in the Big Ten Championship Game and/or College Football Playoff if Michigan wins without him.
      From the Big Ten release: “We impose this disciplinary action even though the Conference has not yet received any information indicating that Head Football Coach Harbaugh was aware of the impermissible nature of the sign-stealing scheme. This is not a sanction of Coach Harbaugh. It is a sanction against the University that, under the extraordinary circumstances presented by this offensive conduct, best fits the violation because: (1) it preserves the ability of the University’s football student-athletes to continue competing; and (2) it recognizes that the head coach embodies the University for purposes of its football program.”
      The Big Ten isn’t punishing Harbaugh. It is punishing Michigan. The Big Ten is also preserving Michigan’s ability to compete while taking out its head coach in its two biggest games of the year during an incomplete investigation. You following this? Does it feel like order has finally been restored to the sport that’s been compromised?
      It doesn’t because it’s nonsense.
      Harbaugh’s day was eventually going to come, and it still might.
      But when the hammer comes down, it should strike with all its force after we know, conclusively, what Michigan did.
      We don’t know that yet.
      Because of that, this just feels wrong.

      Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi arrived in Saudi Arabia on Saturday for a summit on Gaza, state-affiliated media reported, his first visit since the two countries agreed to restore ties in March.
      Footage aired on the Al-Ekhbariya channel showed Raisi, wearing a traditional Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, greeting Saudi officials at the airport after disembarking from his plane.
      The emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) comes after Tehran-backed Hamas’s October 7 massacre in which terrorists killed about 1,200 people in a brutal rampage in southern Israel and took at least 240 hostages to Gaza.
      Israel’s subsequent aerial and ground offensive has killed more than 11,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The terror group’s figures cannot be independently verified, and include members of Hamas as well as Gazans killed by rocket misfires by terrorists.
      The Arab League and the OIC were originally meant to meet separately, but the Saudi foreign ministry announced early Saturday that the blocs’ summits would be combined.
      The move underscores the importance of reaching “a unified collective position that expresses the common Arab and Islamic will regarding the dangerous and unprecedented developments witnessed in Gaza and the Palestinian territories,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
      Middle East leaders have called for a ceasefire while warning the conflict risks drawing in other countries, a threat Raisi on Saturday blamed on Washington’s staunch support for Israel. Iran’s ruling regime encourages Israel’s destruction, and arms and funds Gaza’s Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, terror groups that openly pursue the goal of eliminating the Jewish state.
      “The war machine in Gaza belongs to the US,” he said before departing for Riyadh. “The US has prevented the ceasefire in Gaza and is expanding the scope of the war.”
      Several Western governments have called for a “humanitarian pause” in Israel’s offensive, but not for an immediate ceasefire. For its part, Israel has maintained the stance that Hamas would use a ceasefire to regroup, and that one cannot be implemented without the release of the hostages held by terrorists in the Strip.
      Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Friday condemned “continued violations of international humanitarian law by the Israeli occupation forces,” his first public comments on the war, though Riyadh has leveled similar criticism in multiple statements.
      Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia and Shiite-majority Iran severed ties in 2016 after Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran were attacked during protests over Riyadh’s execution of Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
      But in March, a China-brokered deal saw the long-time rivals agree to restore diplomatic relations and reopen their respective embassies.
      Iran and Saudi Arabia have backed opposing sides in conflict zones across the Middle East for years, including in Yemen, where in 2015, Riyadh mobilized an international coalition against Iran-backed Houthi rebels who had toppled the internationally recognized government the previous year.
      Houthis have launched a number of attacks on Israel in recent weeks, and there are concerns that Tehran may try to widen the conflict using its regional proxies, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror organization.

    content: `Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents spent many of their waking hours in October seated on a wooden bench in a Manhattan courtroom, a few feet behind the former cryptocurrency mogul, watching as federal prosecutors convinced a jury their son had orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in history.
    Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.
    Now, as Bankman-Fried awaits sentencing that could send him to prison for the rest of his life, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried — formerly eminent Stanford Law professors — should worry about their own potential criminal exposure for their roles in their son’s collapsed crypto empire, legal experts say.
    The couple already face a challenge in civil court from the creditors of FTX, the bankrupt crypto exchange that Bankman-Fried co-founded. He gave his parents a $10 million cash gift and bought them a $16.4 million property in the Bahamas that FTX investors and customers have sued to recover, according to the lawsuit.
    Beyond the financial windfall, both parents’ level of involvement with their son’s work will likely bear on their legal vulnerability. Bankman, a tax expert and clinical psychologist, served as an adviser to his son on business matters as far back as 2018 and remained a key member of his inner circle through the exchange’s implosion a year ago, according to the civil suit and evidence from the criminal trial. Fried, an ethics scholar and co-founder of a Democratic fundraising organization, advised her son on concealing campaign donations in a scheme that elicited guilty pleas from two of his top deputies, according to the civil suit.
    Lawyers for Bankman and Fried have said in a statement the claims in the civil suit are “completely false.” Neither has been charged with any criminal wrongdoing. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.
    But the fate of Bankman-Fried’s parents remains a loose thread in the FTX saga. He received “counsel from his parents this entire time, so they’re very, very close to the heart of this story, unfortunately,” said Mark Bini, a former federal prosecutor specializing in financial crime. “The closer a person is to the main defendant, the more likely that a judge or jury would find there was a meeting of the minds on intent.”
    “Their proximity could lead to significant civil exposure and possibly even criminal exposure,” Bini added.
    Prosecutors have wide latitude to determine whom they charge. In addition to the successful prosecution of Bankman-Fried, government attorneys have secured guilty pleas from four of his top executives. And Bankman-Fried himself is set to stand trial again in March on separate charges that he committed bank fraud and bribed Chinese officials. As prosecutors continue to review the matter, they could turn up evidence that would compel them to charge the parents, legal experts say.
    Criminal liability is “not an on-off switch, but a spectrum,” said Renato Mariotti, another former federal prosecutor focused on financial crime.
    “Anyone who is in the mix … or intimately involved with an individual committing a crime and on the radar of federal prosecutors are in a danger zone,” he said. “And Sam’s parents certainly should be concerned about the possibility of charges.”
    In the wake of FTX’s collapse last year, Bankman-Fried said his parents “weren’t involved in any of the relevant parts” of its operations.
    The civil suit filed in September by John J. Ray, the corporate wind-down specialist managing FTX through its bankruptcy, claims otherwise.
    The suit notes Bankman repeatedly referred both to FTX and Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s crypto-focused hedge fund, as a “family business,” and it argues the parents “exploited their access and influence within the FTX enterprise to enrich themselves.”
    The couple “either knew — or ignored bright red flags revealing — that their son, Bankman-Fried, and other FTX Insiders were orchestrating a vast fraudulent scheme,” the suit alleged.
    Officially, Bankman served as an outside adviser to his son until joining the payroll of FTX’s U.S. arm in December 2021, 11 months before its collapse, as a senior adviser to the company’s charitable foundation. But in practice he took on a much broader portfolio, testimony and evidence presented at the criminal trial suggest.
    Bankman counseled FTX engineering director Nishad Singh on a $477 million loan he took from the company, Singh testified. Bankman also participated in 16 Signal group chats with his son and other top executives about company business and was on-hand at FTX’s Bahamas headquarters as it collapsed, accompanying his son to a meeting with the country’s securities regulator, a Bahamian lawyer retained by FTX testified.
    The civil suit also points to Bankman’s inside role. As early as September 2019, Bankman “failed to investigate” a whistleblower complaint that “threatened to expose the FTX Group as a house of cards,” the suit alleges. His status afforded him perks such as private jet flights, $1,200 hotel stays and a cameo in an FTX Super Bowl commercial opposite Larry David.
    Fried, meanwhile, appeared to coach her son on how to obscure the source of campaign funds as part of a $100 million political-influence-buying operation, the civil suit alleges. Singh and Ryan Salame, former co-CEO of FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary, already have pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law for their part in that scheme by making donations that Bankman-Fried reimbursed.
    In an email Fried sent Bankman-Fried in August 2022, she pointed to a contributor who would “only give in a non-disclosed form, and I would strongly urge you to do the same — or substitute someone else’s name,” according to the civil suit. She emailed her son again a week later to “counsel strongly against giving in a disclosed form under your own name.”
    Bankman-Fried replied he “agreed that it doesn’t make sense for me to give disclosed.”
    Both Fried and Bankman were fixtures at their son’s trial, often expressive in a way that contrasted with Bankman-Fried’s stoicism. Bankman would regularly flash his son a thumbs up even in the trial’s tensest moments; Fried, on multiple occasions, broke into tears during breaks in testimonies, her husband’s arm wrapped around her.
    Government attorneys considering charges against Bankman and Fried would need to weigh several factors, former prosecutors say. They would reflect on their view of the parents’ culpability, the strength of the evidence against them, and the extent to which the broader cause of justice would be served by expending limited resources pursuing them.
    “There’s a complicated sort of decision matrix to prosecuting parents for being involved in their son’s crime when the question is really, ‘How much did the parents know?’” said Joshua Naftalis, a former prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case against Bankman-Fried.
    “Going after his parents could be seen as a vindictive overreach,” said Samson Enzer, another former federal prosecutor in Manhattan. And government lawyers could decide it would “add no real value in terms of furthering the goals of prosecution beyond what has already been accomplished through the government’s case against [Bankman-Fried].”
    Yet the scale of the fraud is “very significant,” said Andrew George, a white-collar defense attorney at Baker Botts, adding that could compel prosecutors to pursue additional charges. “That’s a lot of power the government has in this case.”

    content: `Michigan has a lot going on right now, as you all may have noticed. It seems a poor time, then, for the Wolverines to face by far their hardest challenge of the year to date. No team in college football has looked better this year … and no good team has played so few good opponents. I think the Wolverines stumble in Happy Valley as controversy swirls around them, giving Penn State and coach James Franklin a needed big-game win. 
    Liberty loses to Old Dominion as almost a two-touchdown favorite and is basically eliminated from the Group of Five race for the New Year’s Six. In the end, the Flames’ only real shot at finishing as the highest-ranked team from the non-major leagues demands an unbeaten season due to an unimpressive list of wins and the weakness of Conference USA. ODU is more tested after playing two Power Five teams in non-conference play and multiple teams with winning records in the Sun Belt. -- Paul Myerberg
    Oklahoma State gets stunned by Central Florida
    Coming back to Earth emotionally after one of the biggest wins in program history is never an easy task. That is the challenge that faces the Cowboys following their defeat of Oklahoma in the final Bedlam game for the foreseeable future. Now comes a dangerous trip to Orlando against the Knights, who need this game in their quest to become bowl-eligible. The UCF run defense will do enough to contain Ollie Gordon II and lead an upset that shakes up the Big 12 title race. -- Erick Smith
    North Carolina takes down by Duke
    I made the mistake last week of trying to correctly project a result from the muddled mess that is the ACC. Never one to learn from the error of my ways, I step into the breech one more time.
    Here goes – Duke is going to upset North Carolina.
    There is no earthly reason why this should come to pass. Blue Devils’ quarterback Riley Leonard is still sidelined, and the Tar Heels and Drake Maye, despite some inconsistencies this year, are still capable of putting up a big score. But it’s the Duke defense that will answer the bell this week. After a terrific first half of the season, that unit has not been its sharpest in its last few outings. But with a couple extra days of preparation, they’ll come out a lot stronger on Saturday, occasionally bending but not breaking. They’ll also get rest periods thanks to UNC’s leaky front that will allow Duke to move the chains via the ground game. -- Eddie Timanus
    Penn State pulls off upset of Michigan
    Even though I'm not completely sure how Penn State plans to score against one of the best defenses in the country, all the tumult going on at Michigan has to catch up with this team sooner or later. So why not on the road against an opponent that has a lot of talent? History suggests this is a bad pick because Penn State under James Franklin does not beat Michigan (or Ohio State) when Michigan is good. We've seen it again and again with this team. But Michigan has been allowed to cruise through the first nine games of the year against very bad competition, and though the Wolverines are excellent on both sides of the ball, there is probably some competitive atrophy from never playing a good team. It's absolutely bizarre that it's this late in the season and Michigan finally gets a test. Presumably without the benefit of Connor Stalions' inside information on Penn State's signs, this is going to be an upset for the Nittany Lions.  -- Dan Wolken

    content:` Israeli tanks have surrounded a Gaza hospital, its director told CNN, as the territory’s largest healthcare facility came under a reported “bombardment,” heightening fears Friday that Israel’s military campaign is further endangering Gazan patients and medical staff.
    Mustafa al-Kahlout, who heads the Al Nasr hospital and Al Rantisi Pediatric hospital in northern Gaza, told CNN that they were surrounded and asked for the Red Cross to assist with an evacuation. “We are completely surrounded, there are tanks outside the hospital, and we cannot leave,” al-Kahlout said.
    The hospital complex is close to Sheikh Radwan neighborhood and Al Shati camp, where ground fighting was reported by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas separately. “We do not have electricity, no oxygen for the patients, we do not have medicine and water,” al-Kahlout said. “We do not know our fate.”
    His call comes after strikes were reported near several other hospitals in northern Gaza, including al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest medical facility. 
    A World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson said Friday that al-Shifa was “coming under bombardment,” adding that 20 hospitals in the Gaza Strip were “out of action.”
    Asked about a potential Israeli airstrike on al-Shifa hospital on Friday, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said in a briefing: “I haven’t got the detail on al-Shifa but we do know they are coming under bombardment.”
    The Israeli military claimed late Friday that a misfired projectile launched from inside Gaza was responsible for the strike on the al-Shifa hospital.
    “Earlier today, the IDF received reports of a hit on the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The Hamas-run media office in the Gaza Strip immediately claimed that this was a strike carried out by the IDF,” IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht said in a statement sent to CNN.
    The IDF said that an examination of its operational systems had indicated that “a misfired projectile launched by terrorist organizations inside the Gaza Strip hit the Shifa Hospital.”
    Hecht went on to claim that the projectile had been aimed at “IDF troops operating in the vicinity.”
    Several social media videos showed people injured in what was described as al-Shifa’s outpatient clinic. 
    It is unclear what struck the hospital, but the videos show injured people lying on the ground of the outdoor clinic. Witnesses in the videos are saying it was strikes on the area. CNN could not verify it was strikes.
    In a Facebook statement, Al Awda hospital in northern Gaza said that due to the “targeting (of) the vicinity of Al Awda Hospital… and the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital” by Israeli forces, 10 of its employees were injured, infrastructure was hit and nine vehicles were impacted. 
    This included “two ambulances that were completely damaged,” the hospital statement said.
    In a statement Saturday, Doctors Without Borders said it had lost contact with its staff inside Al-Shifa Hospital. “Over the last few hours, the attacks against Al-Shifa Hospital have dramatically intensified. Staff at the hospital reported a catastrophic situation inside,” the humanitarian group said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
    The group said it was extremely concerned about the safety of staff and patients at the medical facility, some of whom were in critical condition and unable to move or evacuate.
    “There is a patient who needs surgery. There is a patient who’s already asleep in our department. We cannot evacuate ourselves and [leave] these people inside. As a doctor, I swear to help the people who need help,” the group quoted Dr. Mohammed Obeid, a surgeon at the hospital, as saying.
    At the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, meanwhile, an imminent shutdown could lead to the death of patients, including babies, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) warned in a statement early Saturday local time.
    “Al-Quds Hospital is at risk of closure in the upcoming 3 hours due to the depletion of fuel supplies and the non-arrival of aid,” the PRCS said. “500 patients and injured will be deprived from medical care. Those who are at the ICU and babies in incubators will lose their lives.”
    On Wednesday, the PRCS said it was scaling back most of its operations amid fuel shortages to ensure the provision of minimal services.
    Human rights groups say Israel’s mass bombardment of civilian areas, evacuation orders and blockade of the territory amount to war crimes. 
    The IDF has not commented on the incidents but has repeatedly called on civilians to move south of Wadi Gaza, a waterway bisecting the center of the Strip, as it intensifies its assault on Gaza City and the north of the territory.
    The IDF has said Hamas is embedding itself in civilian infrastructure and that it will strike Hamas “wherever necessary.” Earlier this month, the IDF released aerial images that it claimed showed rocket launchers and an opening to a tunnel near a pair of Gaza hospitals. CNN cannot verify those claims. The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health and Hamas-controlled government media have rejected claims that hospitals are being used as shields for attacks. 
    Israel began its offensive inside Gaza, following the October 7 Hamas attacks. While Israel had previously said 1,400 people were killed in the attacks, officials said Friday they now believe the total number of people killed to be around 1,200.
    The death toll includes foreign workers and other foreign nationals, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat confirmed.
    The current estimate of 1,200 is not a final number, Haiat emphasized, because some of the bodies are yet to be identified.
    The Israeli military has since stepped up its campaign on northern Gaza in recent days, effectively cutting the territory in two, with its ground operations and fiercest aerial bombardment apparently concentrated in the north.
    The offensive has so far killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled territory. Israeli strikes have killed at least 4,506 children and 3,027 women, according to the ministry, which said that over 27,000 other people have been injured. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.
    But the impact on healthcare facilities has raised concerns about the dire humanitarian situation for those remaining in northern Gaza. The majority of hospitals in Gaza – 18 out of 35 – have stopped functioning, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws its figures from the Hamas-controlled territory, said on Thursday.
    In addition, 71% of all primary-care facilities have shut down due to damage or lack of fuel, the ministry said. Its statement said that the hospitals that remain open are limited in what they can provide and are shutting gradually downwards.
    Meanwhile, Volker Türk, the top United Nations human rights official, on Friday raised doubts over Israel’s unilateral establishment of “safe zones” in Gaza, saying that nowhere within the territory was safe for civilians.

    content:`Iceland declared an emergency and issued evacuation orders for a popular tourist town Saturday after 1,400 earthquakes were recorded in a 24-hour period — sparking fears of an impending volcanic eruption.
    Authorities urged residents of Grindavík to flee the coastal town following the flurry of seismic activity roughly 3 miles below the surface of the Reykjanes Peninsula.
    “There are indications that a considerable amount of magma is moving in an area” near the Fagradalsfjall volcano, about 25 miles southwest of Reykjavik, the country’s capital, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said in an 11:30 p.m. update.
    “The amount of magma involved is significantly more than what was observed in the largest magma intrusions associated with the eruptions at Fagradalsfjall.”
    The tremors are “very similar” to the seismic activity that was measured about a month before the volcano erupted in 2021, which lasted for six months.
    Although heavily encouraged, the civil protection evacuation is not mandated.
    The seismic activity began on Oct. 25, shaking the peninsula with hundreds of small earthquakes every day. Land in the region has risen by 9 centimeters since Oct. 27, according to the IMO.
    In a 24-hour span from Wednesday to Thursday, 1,400 quakes rattled the peninsula — including two exceeding a magnitude of 5.0 and at least seven topping 4.5 on the Richter scale. 
    The lava could threaten the popular destination, as well as the town of Grindavík and the thousands of homes that are heated by the lagoon’s geothermal energy.
    “Presently, there are no signs that earthquake activity is becoming shallower,” the Met said on its website. “However, the situation could change quickly, and it is not possible to exclude a scenario involving a lava-producing eruption in the area northwest of Thorbjorn.”

    content:` Columbia University has suspended two student groups for the rest of the fall semester.
    The school says it's because Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace repeatedly violated school policies.
    Officials cited an event Thursday afternoon involving "threatening rhetoric and intimidation."
    The Chair of the Special Committee on Campus Safety released the following statement:
        "Columbia University is suspending Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) as official student groups through the end of the fall term. This decision was made after the two groups repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event Thursday afternoon that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation. 
        "Suspension means the two groups will not be eligible to hold events on campus or receive University funding.  Lifting the suspension will be contingent on the two groups demonstrating a commitment to compliance with University policies and engaging in consultations at a group leadership level with University officials.
        "Like all student groups, SJP and JVP are required to abide by University policies and procedures. This ensures both the safety of our community and that core University activities can be conducted without disruption. During this especially charged time on our campus, we are strongly committed to giving space to student groups to participate in debate, advocacy, and protest. This relies on community members abiding by the rules and cooperating with University administrators who have a duty to ensure the safety of everyone in our community."
    CBS New York got reaction from some students on campus.
    "I feel like the university should definitely be a place to pro-free speech," student Tiffany Le said.
"That just sounds like they want to stifle a certain crowd of voices to me. I don't know why they wouldn't want to work together with the student groups instead of just suspending them," student Kelsey Harrison said.
We reached out to those two student groups. We have yet to hear back.

    content: `ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Four homeless people have died in Anchorage in the last week, underscoring the city’s ongoing struggle to house a large homeless population at the same time winter weather has returned, with more than 2 feet of snow falling within 48 hours.
    The four bring the total number of people who died while living outdoors in Anchorage to 49 year this year, a record that easily eclipses the 24 people who died on the streets of the state’s largest city last year, according to a count kept by the Anchorage Daily News.
    Eleven of those deaths last year came during winter months.
    This week’s heavy snow covered tents and vehicles that homeless people set up in makeshift camps all over Anchorage when the city closed the mass shelter that was established inside the city’s sports arena during the pandemic.
    While the city cleared at least one of those large camps, some people have decided to rough it outside this winter instead of seeking shelter.
    Of the four recent deaths, a sleeping woman died Thursday after her makeshift shelter caught on fire, possibly caused by some type of heating source used to warm it.
    The three other deaths were all men. One was found dead in the doorway of a downtown gift store where he often slept. Another died alongside a busy road near a Walmart, and the third in a tent at an encampment near the city’s main library.
    Since there were shelter beds available when each person died, other factors may have been at play, including lack of transportation or access to health care, confusion on how to get a shelter bed or onto a wait list, or refusal to go to a shelter, the Anchorage Coalition to End Homelessness said in a statement.
    Ensuring that unsheltered people have access to health care providers, Narcan, fentanyl test strips, harm reduction counseling, and behavioral health treatment are the effective interventions needed to reduce outdoor deaths,” the statement said.
    “It makes you wonder what could we have done better to prevent that from happening,” Felix Rivera, an Anchorage Assembly member who chairs the Housing and Homeless Committee, said of the four deaths.
    The city has pieced together a short-term fix with added temporary shelter beds, but the only way to prevent more deaths is by building more housing, he said.
    We’re going to do what we need to do to make sure that folks aren’t dying outside, but if we’re not focusing on the permanent solution, then a Band-Aid is going to be worse,” he said. “We’re going to run out of funds at some point to be able to continue doing these kind of things.”
    Anchorage has struggled to find a solution to house the homeless after the arena closed.
    The city’s conservative mayor and liberal assembly couldn’t agree on a new mass shelter, leaving Mayor Dave Bronson to suggest the city give out one-way airplane tickets to the homeless to leave the city — an idea that was widely criticized in and outside Alaska.
    That plan was never funded, leaving the city scrambling to find shelter at old hotels and apartment buildings. Late last month, Anchorage opened a new 150-bed mass shelter at the city’s old waste transfer station administration building.
    Alexis Johnson, the city’s homeless director, told The Associated Press at the time the patchwork solution should provide enough beds for the city’s 3,100 or so vulnerable population.
    There were 28 beds open at one facility on Friday, but those would likely be taken before the weekend was out, Rivera said.
    The Bronson administration will present plans at an Assembly meeting next week to add 50 beds to that facility, which Rivera called a welcome move. He also anticipates the administration possibly presenting plans for warming centers and an additional shelter, if necessary.
    City buses didn’t run Thursday or Friday because of the heavy snow, taking away an easy warming place for the homeless, Rivera said. It also prevented many low-income people from being able to travel to shelters or other social service programs.
    During this week’s storm, the temperatures haven’t been bone-chilling, hovering around the 30-degree F mark, but that will soon change. The forecast calls for single-digit temperatures next weekend.
    This week’s storm dropped 17.2 inches of snow at the city’s official recording station, the National Weather Service office near the airport and coastline. However, other parts of Anchorage, especially those closer to the Chugach Mountains on the other side of town, recorded up to 30 inches.
    The snowfall broke two daily records. The 9 inches on Wednesday broke the record of 7.3 inches set in 1982, and the 8.2 inches that fell Thursday broke the record of 7.1 inches, set in 1956, said National Weather Service meteorologist Nicole Sprinkles.
    The community of Girdwood, located about 35 miles south of Anchorage and home to a ski resort, topped out at 3 feet.
    The Anchorage total was on top of about 6 inches that fell Sunday.
    The storm caused widespread power outages, forced schools to either cancel classes or switch to remote learning and prompted some highway closures.

    Following a vote Friday by the majority of SAG-AFTRA‘s National Board to approve a tentative agreement reached with studio CEOs and the AMPTP earlier this week, the actors guild has released more details of the deal.
    As they have repeatedly said over the past two days since reaching a deal with the studios to end the 118-day strike, the guild stated today that “the total package” is “valued at more than one billion dollars in new wages and benefit plan funding.” More compensation information from the deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers came several hours after the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted 86% to approve it.

    Actors Set To Vote On Strike Deal After SAG-AFTRA Board Approves Tentative Agreement – Update
    Fran Drescher & Duncan Crabtree-Ireland of SAG-AFTRA
    “This Was A Negotiation For The Future”: Fran Drescher & Duncan Crabtree-Ireland On SAG-AFTRA Deal, AI & Informed Consent + Importance Of CEOs
    An 80-page summery of the full agreement, which has not been made public, will go to eligible members of the guild November 13, I hear. Ratification voting on the agreement starts November 14 and runs until the first week of December for the eligible members of the 160,000-strong guild.
    Calling the tentative agreement “a landmark achievement for the union,” SAG-AFTRA this evening once again highlighted the “meaningful protections” and consent rights around AI — which had been a big sticking point in discussions with the studios. Unlike today’s press conference with SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher and National Executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Friday’s missive from the guild did not deliver specific numbers for the much vaulted “creation of a new compensation stream for performers working in streaming.”
    With the campaign to win members’ votes already clearly afoot, the guild Friday also had a lot to say about wage increases, casting guidelines, relocation allowances and Health and Pension fund contribution caps. In full pitch mode, some of this came up at today’s press conference after the board vote, though not so detailed.
     Looking at those pay increases, the cumulative total of around 14.8% is better than the 13% the WGA received in its deal a couple months ago. But the rate of increase and two bumps by July 2024 have more to do with SAG-AFTRA’s contact being finalized so late in 2023 — maybe not so much a breaking of the industry pattern, as the guild claims.
    Similar as well to the WGA’s deal is SAG-AFTRA’s criteria for its streaming bonus fund. Both appear to kick in for streaming series and films “that are viewed by 20% or more of the service’s domestic subscribers in the first 90 days of release,” to quote from the WGA agreement.

In full pitch mode, some of this came up at today’s press conference after the board vote, though not so detailed.
    The agreement includes an unprecedented wage pattern with two wage increases in the first year of the contract – 7% upon ratification, and another 4% increase effective July 2024, making a compounded first year increase of 11.28%. There will be another 3.5% increase effective July 2025. This package breaks the so-called “industry pattern.”
    Wages for background actors will increase by 11% effective November 12, 2023, and then by an additional 4% effective July 1, 2024 and by another 3.5% effective July 1, 2025. And in a monumental breakthrough, for the first time ever, the number of covered positions in the West Coast Zones will equal those of the East Coast Zones. This is projected to add almost 11,000 new covered background work days annually.
    A nearly 43% increase to the contribution cap for one-hour productions and nearly 67% increase to the cap for half-hour productions will result in increased contributions to the Health and Pension/Retirement funds, as well as help performers working on those shows to continue qualifying for benefit coverage.
    The union achieved the creation of a new compensation stream for performers working in streaming. It provides a substantial bonus on top of existing residuals structures making work in streaming more sustainable for middle class actors. The majority of that compensation will be paid to actors on programs meeting certain viewership requirements. The remaining money will be distributed to other actors working on those streaming platforms through a new, jointly-trusteed distribution fund. This ensures improved compensation and sustainability for a wider range of actors contributing to the success of those platforms. The agreement also adds fixed residuals for stunt coordinators working on television and new media productions.
    The contract achieved important gains for hair and makeup equity, the sharing of aggregate diversity statistics, eliminating inappropriate wiggings and paintdowns, gender neutral language, access to gender-affirming care, and translation services. It also provides more sexual harassment prevention protections for performers including the use of intimacy coordinators in scenes involving nudity and simulated sex or upon request and additional safeguards for background.
    Additional gains include establishing minimums by applying television terms to high budget made-for-AVOD programming. 
    Meaningful protections for the casting process have been established, including provisions specifying that breakdowns, sides, and/or scripts shall be provided no less than 48 hours prior to the submission deadline (excluding weekends and holidays). This is increased to 72 hours for minors. Talent may not be asked to perform more than eight (8) industry standard pages for a first self-tape or twelve (12) industry standard pages for a second or subsequent call back. Additionally, if memorization is required, performers will be entitled to compensation. And performers may not be requested to appear nude or while wearing attire more revealing than a bathing suit that could be worn at a public pool. Producers must also provide opportunities to interview virtually or in person on a first come, first served basis with accommodations for performers with disabilities, senior performers, and minors.
    Substantial improvements in relocation allowances for series performers were also made, covering $5,000 per month for up to 6 months with no cap on the number of seasons. Based on employment patterns, this amounts to a 153% effective increase in relocation payments.
    Looking at those pay increases, the cumulative total of around 14.8% is better than the 13% the WGA received in its deal a couple months ago.

    Qualifying that “our projections are going to have to be sort of stress tested,” Crabtree-Ireland in the presser today confirmed the total payout to guild members from the streaming bonus fund will be around $120 million over the span of the new contract, or $40 million a year. While setting up a new “pocket” for cast, as Drescher said, and introducing the notion into future talks, that $120 million is far less than the $500 million SAG-AFTRA had been asking for in revenue-sharing demands at the very beginning of talks.
    With all that, Drescher herself admitted that the criteria of the new compensation stream for performers not even starting to flow unless a show is watched by 20% of a steamer’s subscriber base will only mean anything for cast on a “thimble worth of shows.” Attempting to deflect potential criticism of the $120 million streaming bonus fund, which may have resulted in 14% of the guild’s National Board voting against the contract before today’s much-delayed press conference, the recently reelected SAG-AFTRA boss said she hoped to see that 20% fall to 10% in the next contract talks, which will start up ahead of the June 30, 2026 expiration of this contract if it is ratified.
    Talking to Deadline after Friday’s press conference, Drescher also had some hints about what she is preparing ahead of the 2026 negotiations with the studios, and “planning our play and playing our plan.”

    During today’s presser, both Drescher and Crabtree-Ireland praised the deal for shattering pattern bargaining and being “industry-breaking,” similar to the talking-points language used in the material SAG-AFTRA sent out this evening. Whether that proves to be the case or whether SAG-AFTRA’s deal bares many of the hallmarks of what the DGA and the long-striking WGA achieved respectively in June and September of this year remains to be seen once we get a look at the full summary and the fine print.
