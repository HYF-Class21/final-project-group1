// export { default as hookName } from "./source";
// we will write one such export for each hook in the src/hooks folder.
// this way we will be able to import all of the hooks as an object as shown below:
// import { useHooks1, useHook2, useHook3 } from "./hooks";

export { default as useNews } from "./useNews";
